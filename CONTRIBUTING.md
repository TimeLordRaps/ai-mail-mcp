## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Git
- Basic understanding of MCP (Model Context Protocol)
- Familiarity with SQLite and async Python

### First Contribution

1. **Find an Issue**: Look for issues labeled `good first issue` or `help wanted`
2. **Ask Questions**: Don't hesitate to ask for clarification on issues
3. **Start Small**: Begin with documentation fixes or small feature additions
4. **Learn the Codebase**: Read through the existing code to understand the architecture

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Setup

### 1. Fork and Clone

```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub, then clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ai-mail-mcp.git
cd ai-mail-mcp

# Add the original repository as upstream
git remote add upstream https://github.com/TimeLordRaps/ai-mail-mcp.git
```

### 2. Set Up Development Environment

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

# Install development dependencies
pip install -e .[dev]

# Install pre-commit hooks
pre-commit install
```

### 3. Verify Setup

```bash
# Run tests to ensure everything works
pytest

# Run linting
flake8 src tests
black --check src tests
isort --check-only src tests
mypy src

# Start the server to test basic functionality
python -m ai_mail_mcp.server
```

## ‚úèÔ∏è Making Changes

### 1. Create a Branch

```bash
# Update your main branch
git checkout main
git pull upstream main

# Create a feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or for bug fixes:
git checkout -b fix/issue-description
```

### 2. Development Workflow

```bash
# Make your changes
# Edit files, add features, fix bugs

# Add tests for your changes
# Tests should be in tests/ directory

# Run tests frequently
pytest tests/

# Run code quality checks
pre-commit run --all-files
```

### 3. Commit Guidelines

We follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```bash
# Format: <type>[optional scope]: <description>
git commit -m "feat: add message encryption support"
git commit -m "fix: resolve database locking issue"
git commit -m "docs: update installation instructions"
git commit -m "test: add performance benchmarks"
```

**Commit Types:**
- `feat`: New features
- `fix`: Bug fixes
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

## üß™ Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_mailbox.py

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=ai_mail_mcp --cov-report=html

# Run performance tests (slower)
pytest -m slow

# Run without slow tests
pytest -m "not slow"
```

### Writing Tests

- **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions and classes
- **Integration Tests**: Test component interactions
- **Performance Tests**: Benchmark critical operations
- **End-to-End Tests**: Test complete workflows

```python
# Example test structure
def test_feature_description():
    """Test that the feature works as expected."""
    # Arrange
    setup_data()
    
    # Act
    result = function_under_test()
    
    # Assert
    assert result == expected_value
```

### Test Requirements

- All new features must have tests
- Bug fixes must include regression tests
- Maintain minimum 90% test coverage
- Performance tests for critical paths

- **Type Hints**: Use type hints for all public functions
- **Docstrings**: Google style docstrings for all public APIs
- **Comments**: Clear, concise comments for complex logic

### Example Code Style

```python
"""Module docstring describing the module's purpose."""

import os
from datetime import datetime
from typing import List, Optional

from pydantic import BaseModel

from ai_mail_mcp.models import Message


class ExampleClass:
    """Example class with proper styling.
    
    Attributes:
        name: The name of the example.
        value: An optional value.
    """
    
    def __init__(self, name: str, value: Optional[int] = None) -> None:
        """Initialize the example.
        
        Args:
            name: The name for this example.
            value: Optional value parameter.
        """
        self.name = name
        self.value = value
    
    def process_data(self, items: List[str]) -> List[str]:
        """Process a list of items.
        
        Args:
            items: List of strings to process.
            
        Returns:
            Processed list of strings.
            
        Raises:
            ValueError: If items list is empty.
        """
        if not items:
            raise ValueError("Items list cannot be empty")
        
        # Process each item
        return [item.upper() for item in items]
```
